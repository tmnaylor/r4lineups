Description:Since the early 1970s eyewitness testimony researchers have recognised the importance of estimating 
             properties such as lineup bias (is the lineup biased against the suspect, leading to a rate of 
             choosing higher than one would expect by chance?), and lineup size (how many reasonable choices are 
             in fact available to the witness? A lineup is supposed to consist of a suspect and a number of 
             additional members, or foils, whom a poor quality witness might mistake for the perpetrator). Lineup 
             measures are descriptive, in the first instance, but since the earliest articles in the literature 
             researchers have recognised the importance of reasoning inferentially about them. This package 
             contains functions to compute various properties of laboratory or police lineups, and is intended for 
             use by researchers in forensic psychology and/or eyewitness testimony research. The measures in this
             package were originally proposed by Doob & Kirshenbaum (1973), Wells, Leippe & Ostrom (1979), Malpas 
             (1981), Tredoux (1998, 1999), and Malpass, Tredoux & McQuiston-Surrett (2007). Among others, the
             r4lineupspackage includes functions for calculating lineup proportion, functional size, various 
             estimates of effective size, diagnosticity ratio, homogeneity of the diagnosticity ratio, ROC curves 
             for confidence x accuracy data and the degree of similarity of faces in a lineup. Further information 
             on the particular measures of lineup fairness can be found  in Tredoux, C. G. (1998). Statistical 
             inference on measures of lineup fairness. Law and Human Behavior, 22(2), 217-237.
