\description{
A dataframe containing real lineup data.

             3 columns x 94 observations.

             The first column simply provides the participant number, whilst
             the second and third contain data for each participant's choice (i.e., the position of the
             lineup member that they identified) and a confidence score for each choice.

             In the field of eyewitness testimony, it is common for participants to rate how confident
             they are that they have accurately identified the perpetrator.
             Here, confidence is recorded as a percentage.

             This lineup has the following parameters:

             \itemize{
             \item 94 mock witness choices

             \item Target position is 7

             \item Nominal size is 9
             }
}
