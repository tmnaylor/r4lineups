#'Diagnosticity ratio weights
#'
#'Function to compute weights of each diagnosticity ratio  for k lineup pairs
#'@param linedf A dataframe of parameters for computing diagnosticity ratio
#'@details In order to obtain a pooled estimate of a set of diagnosticity ratios,
#'         we use a weight for each ratio that is equal to the inverse of its
#'         variance.
#'
#'         linedf dataframe is computed using the diag_param helper function,
#'          diag_param: returns a dataframe containing the following:
#'          n11: Number of mock witnesses who identified the suspect in the target
#'              present condition
#'          n21: Number of mock witnesses who did not identify the suspect in the
#'              target present condition
#'          n12: Number of mock witnesses who identified the suspect in the target
#'              absent condition
#'          n13: Number of mock witnesses who did not identify the suspect in the
#'              target absent condition
#'              
#'          
#'@returns A dataframe with one column containing weights for each pair of
#'         lineups for which diagnosticity ratio is being calculated.
